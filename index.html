<p>Data from the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Leading-Causes-of-Death-United-States/bi63-dtpu" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> shows that <strong>not only is the number of suicides increasing,</strong> but suicides are also <strong>becoming a larger percentage of total deaths.</strong> </p>

<p>The percentage of people taking their own life has been on the rise since 1999. According to the CDC, in 2016, suicide and intentional self-harm was the tenth most common cause of death, while heart disease was number one. <strong>However, heart disease fatalities are shrinking, while suicides are growing.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li> 2016 suicides: 44,965 suicides</li> <li>2016 heart disease deaths: 635,260 </li> <li> 1999 suicides: 29,1999</li> <li> 1999 heart disease deaths: 725,192</li> </ul> <h4>So, if other causes of death are decreasing, why is suicide increasing?</h4>

<p><strong>“There are no definitive answers as to why the suicide rates are increasing,” </strong>said Dan Reidenberg, managing director at the <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" target="_blank">National Council for Suicide Prevention.</a> “We think there are potentially multiple factors: better reporting of suicide, military and veteran suicides, the opioid crisis, media reporting on suicide and contagion, entertainment industry, social media, economic factors, et cetera.”</p>


<p>The rising population can’t be blamed for the rising suicides, because suicide is also becoming a larger percentage of all deaths.</p>





<p>On average, the percentage of suicide deaths out of all deaths in each state is 1.79 percent. New Jersey is the only state where suicides are less than one percent of all deaths. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Wyoming, Utah and Alaska are the only states where the percentage is above three percent. Looking at the <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/03/datapoint.aspx" target="_blank">distribution of psychologists,</a> these states do have an average distribution, so why is suicide such a large problem in these states, and what is New Jersey getting right?<p>

<h3>New Jersey</h2>

<p>New Jersey has the lowest suicide rate of all 50 states. While the national suicide hotline is available to everyone, New Jersey does have its own state-specific hotline- the New Jersey Hopeline. Furthermore, <strong>veterans are at a particular risk for suicide due to post-traumatic stress, so New Jersey offers a veteran-specific hotline for mental health issues.</strong> New Jersey also has a very <strong>high concentration of psychologists,</strong> according to the American Psychological Association. </p>


<p>New Jersey also has <strong><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-jersey-gun-laws_us_5b203d57e4b0bbb7a0e2849b" target="_blank">strict gun laws,</strong></a> making it hard to obtain the weapon often used to carry-out suicide. In New Jersey, you need a background check to buy a gun. Law enforcement can also seize someone’s gun if a mental health professional asks them too, and citizens can file gun violence restraining orders against individuals believed to be at “significant risk” of hurting themselves or others. This may help people who are suicidal not only lose access to the means to do so, but also get the help they need.</p>





<h3>Utah</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.health.utah.gov/vipp/pdf/Suicide/youth-suicide-factsheet-12-14.pdf" target="_blank">Utah Department of Public Health,</a> <strong>suicide is the leading cause of death for Utah kids ages 11 to 17.</strong> Moreover, <strong>42 percent of LGBT teenagers in Utah seriously considered suicide in 2015, compared to just 14 percent of heterosexual teens.</strong> </p>

<p>Utah’s medical examiner’s office recently hired sociologist Michael Staley to look into the teen suicide problem, and he suspects <strong>sexuality, religion and suicide are all linked.</strong></p>

<p>“They’d be fine,” Staley told the <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2018/04/07/utah-needs-a-better-strategy-to-prevent-suicide-a-researcher-is-about-to-spend-years-talking-with-grieving-families-to-design-it/" target="_blank">Salt Lake Tribune.</a> “They’d come out of the closet, they’d be happy that they came out of the closet. And then, they’d start to experience subtle rejection in their coming-out process — being gay, being Mormon, trying to make these two identities mesh.”</p>

<p>Utah is known for their Church of the Latter Day Saints population, and the Church requires all gay members to be celibate, and they believe same-sex marriage to be a rejection of the Church. Perhaps young LGBT people in the state feel more anxious about the future due to the conflict between the church and their sexuality. </p>

<h3>Wyoming</h3>

<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/suicide-in-wyoming/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a> reports that <strong>Wyoming has the highest rate of gun suicides.</strong> This makes sense, as <strong>Wyoming has <a href="https://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/state-gun-laws/wyoming/" target="_blank">loose gun laws:</strong></a> anyone over 21 can purchase and carry a rifle, handgun or shotgun. Therefore, people have easy access to potential self-harm weapons.</p>

<p>There, about <strong>80 percent of suicides are men, and a quarter are men ages 45-64. </strong>Psychologist Caroyln Pepper told FiveThirtyEight she thinks unemployment and alcohol both contribute to the suicide rate in Wyoming. The <a href="https://www.wamhsac.org/images/clientid_291/2015_WAMHSAC_Legislative_Report_-_Final.pdf" target="_blank">Wyoming Association of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Centers</a> reports that 18 percent of Wyoming citizens have an alcohol-related disorder, and 11 percent have substance abuse disorder. Both conditions are considered high-risk for suicide.</p>

<h3>Alaska</h3>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.alaskapublic.org/interactive/?page_id=264" target="_blank">Alaska Public Radio,</a> <strong>most suicides in Alaska are within the Native population. </strong>Patrick Sidmore, health planner and research analyst at Alaska Mental Health Board, says Alaskan Natives go through historical trauma, or trauma that occurred in past generations but still effects modern Natives, putting them at a higher risk of suicide. </p>

<p>Furthermore, Alaska’s isolation and rural landscape makes it <strong>hard for Natives to reach mental health treatment centers, </strong>which are primarily <a href="http://www.alaska211.org/MatchList.aspx?c99;;0;;;25347;0;Mental%20Health/Substance%20Abuse;Mental%20Health%20Services;318;Inpatient%20Mental%20Health%20Facilities" target="_blank">in Anchorage,</a> which can be hard for those in rural areas to get to.</p>

<p>In general, rural areas see more suicides due to a lack of resources.</p>

<p>“We believe there are more suicides in rural areas- true globally, not just in the U.S.- because of lack of resources, lack of access to care, more isolation, lack of support systems, often in the US more access to firearms,” said Reidenberg. </p>

<p>Stricter gun laws preventing those with mental illness coupled with widespread mental health care may be the answer to those states struggling most with suicide, as states with helplines and strict gun laws like New Jersey see declining suicide rates. Though suicide is a growing epidemic, modern awareness of the problem and a fight to combat the stigma of mental health may both help lower suicide rates and ensure those who need help receive it.</p>
